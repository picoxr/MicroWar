# Multiplay
Multiplay is an important part of the game, to implement multiplay features, we introduced Unity's Netcode package in order to connect Netcode and PICO SDK's data exchange interface via a custom Transport. The PICO server is considered as a relay server to enable player play on the wide area network.
