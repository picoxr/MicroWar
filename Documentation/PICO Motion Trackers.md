> [!NOTE]
> **Body tracking** is a motion capture technology that collects a user's body positions, converting them to positions and actions within a virtual environment. Body tracking enables a user to run, kick, walk, and perform other actions in a VR scene, enriching the user's interaction with your app.

> PICO's body tracking capability requires **PICO Motion Tracker** - an accessory that captures a user's body positions. Body tracking APIs convert body positions into pose data for body joints, which serves as the input for your app. You can also use body tracking APIs to retrieve PICO Motion Tracker's connection status, battery level, and calibration status.
